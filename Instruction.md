> This is a hands-on coding exercise designed to be completed within a limited timeframe.\
> Its primary goal is to facilitate discussion during a potential future interview.\
> We recommend allocating no more than 2 hours to this exercise, even if you're unable to fully complete the mandatory section.

## üìÑ Instructions

This exercise contains a mandatory part, the [Minimum Valuable Product](#-mvp).\
üö® MVP implementation should contain business logic; it is not just a handoff solution!

It's important to note that stories do not come with acceptance criteria; it's your responsibility to define them based on your functional analysis and understanding.\
üö® You must demonstrate that your solution meets the requirements outlined in the MVP.

Additionally, you have the opportunity to incorporate [Bonus Features](#-bonus-features) to demonstrate your ability to stand out and make the most of any remaining time.

**If you find yourself lacking certain information, please make a decision and ensure that your chosen approach remains consistent.**
